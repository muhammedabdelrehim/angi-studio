# angi studio

This is a repository for angi studio's front-end development challenge.

This part of the assignment took me a good 20 hours or so. I hope it is to your liking!

## **Setting up the project:**

### In Terminal:

> git clone git@github.com:muhammedabdelrehim/angi-studio.git

> yarn cache clean && yarn install

> run yarn storybook
